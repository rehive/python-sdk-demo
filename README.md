# Python Service Demo

Basic SDK usage in the context of a mico service.

This service will automatically transfer 10% of each credit transaction a user gets to a "savings" account.

**NB: This service is not intended for production usage as it has multiple security flaws. The service should simple be used as an example of how webhooks and the Rehive python SDK can be used.**
